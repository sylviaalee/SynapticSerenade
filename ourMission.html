    <h1>Our Mission</h1>
    <h4>Our mission is to bring comfort, joy, and cognitive stimulation to individuals experiencing dementia, cognitive decline, and other age-related challenges. We aim to organize groups of musicians to perform requested songs for seniors in hospitals and nursing homes. Research supports that music can alleviate symptoms of dementia and cognitive decline, enhancing brain function and overall well-being.</h4>
